Ran Example
===========

This is an example of a code example which is displayed **and** ran.

.. note::
    See :ref:`example` for an example which is displayed but **not** ran.

The examples can include documentation in the docstrings and comments alongside
the code and outputs. Text uses the reStructuredText format, the same as other
documentation in Sphinx.

# Formatted text can be written before or between the cells using Python comments
# and docstrings.
